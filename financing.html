        <h1>Financing</h1>
    <p>The project can be financed by organizations, such as "Redd Barna" and funds from local
        governments and school administrations. Since this is a solution that should be relatively
        affordable to operate, the financing is planned to be achievable. Private givers are an
        important source of contribution for "Redd Barna", so it is important to inform and engage
        this group. "Redd Barna" has already many valuable partners, project partners, campaign
        partners and corporate sponsors which can be excellent contributors.</p>

    <p>Fundraising to gather economical contribution on the same level that "Redd Barna" already does,
        engage primary and secondary schools, as well as sports clubs to arrange fundraisers and
        highlight the theme, and campaign driven fundraisers on social media are also valuable
        solutions to achieve the financing.
