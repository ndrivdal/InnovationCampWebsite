        <div class="textOS">
            <p>For our solution we have chosen areas and countries with limited access to modern infrastructure such as electricity and internett.
                 We wished to create a solution that is relatively cheap to operate and that requires minimal training of teachers on a local level to put in use. 
                 The solution must also be universal, so a separate absence system for schools without access to relevant infrastructure wonâ€™t need to exist .
            </p>
            <p>
                Our solution is a machine readable abscens document which is sent to a central database.
            </p>
            <p>
                A statistic that shows patterns of attendance and absence over time nationally, regionally and locally,
                 will help the administration to have an overview of pupils that are struggling, and let them adjust the curriculum for them.
                  With few links between those who have the statistics, to the one who implements the measures themselves, to create a better learning environment.
                   Cause of absence will be registered, and can be done anonymously.
                    The pupils that have registered absence will be sent a form, where they can fill out causes behind absence if it occurs over a longer time.
