            <p id="oursolution">For our solution we have chosen areas and countries with limited access to modern infrastructure such as electricity and internett.
                 We wished to create a solution that is relatively cheap to operate and that requires minimal training of teachers on a local level to put in use. 
                 The solution must also be universal, so a separate absence system for schools without access to relevant infrastructure won't need to exist .
            </p>
            <p>
                Our solution is a machine readable abscens document which is sent to a central database.
            </p>
            <p>
                A statistic that shows patterns of attendance and absence over time nationally, regionally and locally,
                 will help the administration to have an overview of pupils that are struggling, and let them adjust the curriculum for them.
                  With few links between those who have the statistics, to the one who implements the measures themselves, to create a better learning environment.
                   Cause of absence will be registered, and can be done anonymously.
                    The pupils that have registered absence will be sent a form, where they can fill out causes behind absence if it occurs over a longer time.
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="pros">Pros</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Relatively cheap technology</li>
                <li>Gives overview over absence from multiple school</li>
                <li>Achieves statistics which kan map trends and possibilities to identify regions with special challenges</li>
                <li>&rdquo;Redd Barna&rdquo; and local governments will have the possibility to create targeted measures against those groups </li>
                <li>A database will be created on why children are absent from schools, which &rdquo;Redd Barna&rdquo; at the current point of time doesnâ€™t have enough knowledge about</li>
                <li> Collect historical data - this will give a good possibility to see if the implemented measurements have an effect, since data will be submitted continuesly </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The documents must be transported physically (logistics, risk of loss)</li>
                <li>It can be hard to achieve detailed information through a machine readable document</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="technicalsolution">How the technical solution will work</h2>
            <p>
                A machine will read a document containing registration of absence which will be forwarded to a database.
                The point is that documents will be sent to central institutions. 
                This functions by that local schools with limited access to digital tools fill out machine readable documents which will be forwarded to central institutions where they will be registered and implemented inn to a central database.
